(list of some pros and cons of deadlock dealing methods)

I. Recovery
	Advantage: never delays process initialization
	Disadvantage: cause preemption losses
II. Prevention
	Advantage: works well whenever a process state can be saved
	Disadvantage: delays process initialization
III. Avoidance
	Advantage: no neccessary preemption needed 
	Disadvantage: future requirements must be know by OS

I. Recovery method is better when OS is dealing with
a process that should be procceded fastly 
(Prevention and Avoidance methods may take some time)

II. Prevention method is better when a process state can be saved
It mostly prevents data corruption 
(while Recovery and Avoidance methods may cause 
unintended losses in time and data)

III. Avoidance method is better when there are provided 
means to get the resource requirements so it figures the safe way
faster (while other methods affect preemption and cause delays)
