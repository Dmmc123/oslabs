Physical address is the actual adresss refering to some location in RAM while virtual address is generated by CPU and connected with physical address via mapping. 
Moreover, virtual address is more like an abstraction created to secure the space of a program memory (each program has its own scope) and to widen the whole address scope (we are no longer limited to size of RAM).
