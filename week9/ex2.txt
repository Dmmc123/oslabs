Let N be the parameter for the program

With N = 10 set, to increase the hit/miss ratio I used sequence 
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 
And got ratio 7/3

This is because sequence contains the majority of numbers of frequently used pages 
And via aging algorithm only first 3 are considered as misses

Meanwhile the ratio can be decreased if the sequence would look somehow like this
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 20
And the corresponding ratio 1/20

It happened because the program got the only hit when the last 20 
coincided with the previously used page (20)
